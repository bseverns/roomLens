# CONCEPT — Room Lens

**Tagline:** *A site‑sensing instrument that “plays” a room.*

## Intent
- **Listen to place**: translate light, air, presence, and structure into sound behaviors.
- **Reveal scenes**: expose invisible rhythms—HVAC cycles, crowd tides, sun drift—as musical form.
- **Teach mapping**: give learners a rigorous, malleable pipeline from sensing → features → gesture → sound.

## Design constraints
- **Scene-first**: mappings are grounded in phenomena, not arbitrary knob twiddling.
- **Low‑friction**: hardware and host can be minimal; OSC/MIDI keeps engines swappable.
- **Ethical by default**: process in RAM; saving requires explicit opt‑in (see PRIVACY_ETHICS).

## Influences
- Acoustic ecology & soundscape composition.
- Data‑driven music (gesture→synthesis mappings).
- Classroom‑friendly instrumentation that invites tinkering.
